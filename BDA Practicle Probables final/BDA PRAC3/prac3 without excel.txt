write a r program to find the levels of factors of given vector, also create a vector corresponding to height of women dataset, which contains height and weight for a sample of person?


# Function to find the levels of factors in a given vector
find_factor_levels <- function(vec) {
  if (is.factor(vec)) {
    return(levels(vec))
  } else {
    return("Input vector is not a factor.")
  }
}

# Create a vector corresponding to height and weight of women dataset
height <- c(160, 165, 170, 155, 158) # Heights in cm
weight <- c(55, 60, 65, 50, 52)      # Weights in kg
women_dataset <- data.frame(height, weight)

# Print factor levels and women dataset
print("Factor levels:")
print(find_factor_levels(women_dataset))
print("\nWomen dataset:")
print(women_dataset)
